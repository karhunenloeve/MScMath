The end of my studies closes one chapter and, mercifully, does not open a new one titled “Errata”. Writing this thesis took persistence from me and, more importantly, time, patience, and kindness from the people around me. It was a demanding stretch, but also a very happy one. Thank you to everyone who made it possible.

This work sits where algebraic topology meets operator algebras, a place where ideas commute less often than one might hope. I am grateful to my lecturers Cathérine Meusburger, Gandalf Lechner, Peter Fiebig, Thomas Creutzig, and Hermann Schulz-Baldes for excellent courses that provided the background this thesis relies on.

I also thank the department for making it financially possible for me to study mathematics through tutoring positions in linear algebra, analysis, topology, functional analysis, and engineering mathematics. I am especially grateful to Karl-Hermann Neeb, Cathérine Meusburger, Kang Li, and Michael Fried for trusting me with these opportunities.

My special thanks go to Aidan Sims, who visited our university and gave a lecture series on the homology of ample groupoids while I was working on this thesis. Between the discussions during the lectures and our evening conversations over dinner, I learned a great deal and gained real traction on the subject. His stay was as enjoyable as it was enlightening. Thank you.

I am also very grateful to Christian Bönicke. He took the time to discuss my results once they were written down, suggested nontrivial examples, and improved this thesis through careful listening and perfectly timed, practical advice. The evening at Alter Simpl and our conversations were both instructive and great fun. Thank you.

I thank my supervisors Kang Li and, as my mentor in the Master’s programme, Cathérine Meusburger, and I also thank Karl-Hermann Neeb once again. I could always come to them with questions and receive quick, thoughtful replies. Their guidance was invaluable, both mathematically and for what comes next. It was a pleasure working with you. Thank you.

I would also like to thank the teaching staff Christian van de Ven, Ricardo Correa da Silva, Michael Preeg, Tobias Simon, and Matthias Bauer for a wonderful time.

Finally, my deepest thanks to my partner, Luciana Diaconescu, who had to listen to all of this and still chose to listen. She will soon be writing her own thesis, and I hope I can repay her patience with the same steadiness she showed me and my moods.
